# Pacmen Exercise

<img src="PacMan1.png">

## Description of Project

In this project, you will be able to generate multiple pacmen and have them bounce around the confines of your screen. This project was to help cement the ideas of DOM manipulation.

## How to Run

To run, please download the files and load the index.html in your browser.

## Roadmap of future improvements

Future improvements will show the pacmen changing their facing directions as the meet the side of the screen. I would also like to improve the navigation bar so that it will not interfere with the rest of the code.
