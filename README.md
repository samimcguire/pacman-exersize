# Pacmen Exercise
<img src="PacMan1.png">
## Description of Project
In this project, you will be able to generate multiple pacmen and have them bounce around the confines of your screen. This project was to help cement the ideas of DOM manipulation.
## How to Run: This is information someone would use to get started running your project on their machine.
To run, please download the files and load the index.html in your browser.
## Roadmap of future improvements
Future improvements will show the pacmen changing their facing directions as the meet the side of the screen. I would also like to improve the navigation bar so that it will not interfere with the rest of the code.
## License information: This should include information about the MIT license.
